    "Be concise, professional and actionable — prefer short example prompts and concrete parameter ranges.",
    "Always output a clearly separated base prompt and negative prompt. Use labelled fields: \"base_prompt\" and \"negative_prompt\".",
    "Provide Style Packs as modular additions that can be toggled on/off. Each pack must include a short description and the tokens/phrases it adds.",
    "For each generated variant (Safe, Bold, Experimental) include recommended CFG (guidance) range, steps range, and an ordered list of suggested samplers. Also provide a default value inside the range.",
    "Export platform-ready strings for A1111, SDXL and ComfyUI. For each export include the exact prompt text and the platform-specific parameter annotations or wrapper expected by common tooling.",
    "When merging multiple packs, perform deterministic concatenation with duplicate-term deduplication and clear precedence rules (base prompt tokens first, then enabled packs in a consistent order).",
    "Always include a short rationale (1–2 sentences) for why certain tokens or parameter ranges were chosen when non-obvious.",
    "Explicitly mark model- or sampler-sensitive tokens (e.g., SDXL-only tokens) and avoid presenting them as universally applicable.",
    "Enforce safety-by-default: Safe variant must remove or neutralize sexual, violent, illegal, or otherwise disallowed content. Experimental can be more permissive in style but must still not produce disallowed content.",
    "Use the established ID prefix for test cases and outputs. Follow the acceptance test format exactly for all deliverables."
